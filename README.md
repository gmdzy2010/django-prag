# realbio_prag
The Pipeline of Report Auto-Generations (PRAG) coupled with `wkhtmltopdf`.      
(What's wkhtmltppdf? here: https://github.com/wkhtmltopdf/wkhtmltopdf)      
        
### Introduction
This package supplied interfaces to common data file such as csv, tsv, txt, xls/xlsx using the package of `pandas`, django queryset (lower level to SQL database is coming soon) and stdout data source, and rendered such dataset to pdf file using python template package `jinja2`. To accelerate the pdf-rendering process in bulk, the async multiprocess method in `multiprocessing` is applied.

### Main packages that meant to be used
>1.`multiprocess` or `threading`: this pipeline should use the multiprocess package to improve the efficiency               
>2.`jinjia2`: template-parsing frame to deal with the html file    
>3.`pandas`: the data structure which data in html template should store   
>4.to be continued ...      

### What's now
As so far, the key module `get_original_data.py` and `render_data.py` are finished partially, some simple functions test were run and then passed, but no unittest.

### What's next
The next step is to finish the subclass of FileDataSource and StdoutDataSource.
